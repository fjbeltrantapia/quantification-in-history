The article **Quantifying history** (available in Blackboard) is compulsory reading. It outlines the advantages and disadvantages of using quantitative and computational methods in history. We will be discussing this text at the beginning of the session before moving on and explore how quantitative methods are implemented in practice using two historical case-studies: the [Paisley prison dataset]((backg-paisley.html)) and the [State of the Union Addresses]((backg-speeches.html)).
